# Dark New Tab, *now with 20% less bullshit!*
![image](https://github.com/dandydanny/darknewtab/blob/master/darknewtab_github_screen_ani.gif)
A minimalistic grey new tab page for Google Chrome. No external network requests. No analytics. No tracking. No bullshit. And no animation.

### What?
1. A minimalistic new tab page replacement for Chrome.
1. New tab page is a static dark grey page; no distracting animation.

### Why?
1. Default Chrome new tab page makes network requests and show thumbnail images of previously visited sites
Some new tab page extensions can be slow to launch if system is low on resources
1. I don't want distractions
1. I don't want to be blinded by a white page whenever I open a new tab

### Where?
Install it manually:
clone master or download zip and extract
load as unpacked on dev mode enabled extenstions page

### Changelog
* v1.3 - Removed "Dark New Tab" text from tab
* v1.2 - Initial limited release on Chrome Web Store; mouserOver brightness boost removed
* v1.1 - Initial, unreleased code for personal use
 

### About
Spaceoden thanks Daniel the original extension.
